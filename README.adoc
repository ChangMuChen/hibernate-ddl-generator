My first attempt of a Maven plugin to generate JPA DDL with Hibernate (including Envers).

The plugin at this testing stage is self-contained, i.e. generates DDL in `target/ddl` for a
single entity included in the plugin itself (`AuditedEntity`).

Currently does not work with Java 9, any help from Hibernate team or Maven experts appreciated!

To test, install the plugin and run:

[source]
----
$ mvn install
$ mvn to.lova:hibernate-ddl-generator:generate-ddl
----

and it will fail with:

[source]
----
Unable to perform unmarshalling at line number 3 and column 40. Message: unexpected element
(uri:"http://www.hibernate.org/xsd/orm/hbm", local:"hibernate-mapping"). Expected elements
are <{}hibernate-mapping> : origin(envers): UnmarshalException
----

But if you just change the Java version in the POM to 1.8 and re-install, running again
will succeed with the DDL generated in `target/ddl/h2/create.sql`.
